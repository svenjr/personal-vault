This is my vault for my knowledge base. It stands to contain all of the notes I take myself. I plan to use it from anything from readmes for new technologies I learn or cheat sheets for quick commands I know I will foroget in the future. I could also expand it from there as well beyond just technologies with also blog-like posts about failures I have encountered or learnings from internal incidents.

The basis for this vault is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is a sort of knowledge-base note-taking app. It is really just a place where you can write down and link whatever you want but it has this added feature of connecting linked documents together and displaying that visually. That should help with figuring out which technologies are close to eachother and which are connected in some way. Those connections are made by you which is the cool part - but you also need to keep things small and contained but also connected. 

This vault is checked in via Git to a private repo of mine which I will simply commit directly to the main branch.
